### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these issues:

- Issues labeled `good first issue`
- Issues labeled `help wanted`
- Issues labeled `documentation`

## Development Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our style guidelines

3. **Write or update tests** for your changes

4. **Run the test suite**:
   ```bash
   npm test
   npm run lint
   npm run typecheck
   ```

5. **Update documentation** if needed

6. **Commit your changes** using our commit message conventions

7. **Push to your fork** and submit a pull request

## Style Guidelines

### TypeScript Style Guide

We follow strict TypeScript guidelines:

- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Always use explicit return types for functions
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs

### Code Formatting

- We use Prettier for code formatting
- Run `npm run format` before committing
- ESLint configuration is enforced via pre-commit hooks

### File Organization

```

â”œâ”€â”€ auth/           # Authentication modules
â”œâ”€â”€ tools/          # MCP tool implementations
â”œâ”€â”€ servers/        # Server implementations

```

## Commit Messages

We follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that don't affect code meaning
- `refactor`: Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: Performance improvement
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Changes to build process or auxiliary tools

### Examples

```
feat(tools): add bulk property activation tool

Add new MCP tool for activating multiple properties simultaneously.
Includes rate limiting and error recovery mechanisms.

Closes #123
```

```
fix(auth): resolve token rotation race condition

Ensure tokens are properly invalidated before creating new ones
during rotation process.
```

## Pull Requests

### Before Submitting

1. **Test your changes** thoroughly
2. **Update documentation** as needed
3. **Add tests** for new functionality
4. **Ensure CI passes** all checks
5. **Keep PR scope focused** - one feature/fix per PR

### PR Process

1. **Fill out the PR template** completely
2. **Link related issues** using keywords (Closes #123)
3. **Request reviews** from maintainers
4. **Address review feedback** promptly
5. **Keep PR updated** with main branch

### PR Title Format

Follow the same convention as commit messages:
```
feat(tools): add new property comparison tool
```

## Security Vulnerabilities

**DO NOT** create public issues for security vulnerabilities. Instead:

1. Email [security@alecs.io](mailto:security@alecs.io)
2. Include detailed steps to reproduce
3. Wait for acknowledgment before disclosure

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for more details.

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- src/tools/__tests__/property-tools.test.ts

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in `__tests__` directories
- Name test files with `.test.ts` extension
- Use descriptive test names
- Test both success and error cases
- Mock external dependencies

### Test Structure

```typescript
describe('ToolName', () => {
  describe('handler', () => {
    it('should successfully execute with valid parameters', async () => {
      // Arrange
      const params = { /* ... */ };
      
      // Act
      const result = await handler(params);
      
      // Assert
      expect(result).toMatchObject({
        content: expect.arrayContaining([
          expect.objectContaining({
            type: 'text',
            text: expect.stringContaining('Success')
          })
        ])
      });
    });
    
    it('should handle errors gracefully', async () => {
      // Test error cases
    });
  });
});
```
