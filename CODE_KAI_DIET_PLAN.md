# üéØ CODE KAI DIET PLAN - ALECS MCP Server Deduplication

> **"From 189 tools to 25-30 tools - The Great Simplification"**

## üìä Current State Analysis

**Total Tool Count**: 189 tools across 3 competing architectures
- **4 Workflow Assistants** (infrastructure, dns, security, performance)
- **5 Consolidated Tools** (property, dns, certificate, search, deploy)  
- **180+ Individual Tools** (scattered across 61 files)

**Problem**: Massive cognitive load, overlapping functionality, maintenance nightmare

**Goal**: Reduce to 25-30 focused, non-duplicative tools

---

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: Three-Layer Architecture Conflict

Instead of one coherent system, we have **3 competing approaches**:

1. **Workflow-First**: Business user assistants that guide through complex tasks
2. **Consolidated-First**: Technical power-user tools with comprehensive features  
3. **Individual-First**: Granular API-level tools for maximum control

**CODE KAI Decision Required**: Choose ONE primary architecture + minimal secondary support

---

## üü¢ PHASE 1: LOW RISK - Immediate Wins (READY TO EXECUTE)

### **‚úÖ Safe Deletions - Zero Risk**

**1. Universal Search Duplicate**
```bash
DELETE: src/tools/universal-search-simplified.ts
REASON: Inferior implementation, universal-search-with-cache.ts does everything better
IMPACT: -1 tool, eliminate user confusion
EFFORT: 2 minutes
```

**2. Deprecated DNS Function Cleanup**
```typescript
FILE: src/tools/dns-tools.ts:1675
FUNCTION: upsertRecord() // marked @deprecated  
ACTION: Remove from all-tools-registry.ts registration
REASON: Deprecated function still accessible to users
IMPACT: Clean deprecated functionality
EFFORT: 3 minutes
```

**3. Development Artifacts**
```bash
SEARCH FOR: Files ending in "-backup.ts", "-old.ts", "-temp.ts"
ACTION: Delete if found
REASON: Development leftovers cluttering codebase
EFFORT: 5 minutes
```

**Expected Phase 1 Result**: Remove 5-10 duplicate tools in ~10 minutes

---

## üü° PHASE 2: MEDIUM RISK - Requires Testing (30-60 min)

### **üîÑ Function Name Duplicates**

**1. cancelPropertyActivation - Perfect Duplicate**
```typescript
// REMOVE from: src/tools/property-manager-advanced-tools.ts:658
function cancelPropertyActivation() // Basic implementation

// KEEP in: src/tools/property-activation-advanced.ts:911  
function cancelPropertyActivation() // Enhanced with monitoring
```

**2. searchProperties - Three Implementations**
```typescript
CONSOLIDATE:
- src/tools/property-manager-advanced-tools.ts:750 (searchProperties)
- src/tools/property-operations-advanced.ts (searchPropertiesAdvanced)  
- src/tools/consolidated/search-utils.ts (universal search)

RECOMMENDATION: Keep universal search, deprecate property-specific versions
```

**3. Basic vs Enhanced Duplicates**
```typescript
MERGE THESE PAIRS:
- createEdgeHostname() ‚Üê createEdgeHostnameEnhanced()
- listPropertyVersions() ‚Üê listPropertyVersionsEnhanced()  
- createPropertyVersion() ‚Üê createPropertyVersionEnhanced()

STRATEGY: Merge enhanced features into base functions, add feature flags
```

**Expected Phase 2 Result**: Remove 15-25 duplicate tools

---

## üü† PHASE 3: HIGH IMPACT - Architectural Decisions (DESIGN REVIEW REQUIRED)

### **üèóÔ∏è Tool Architecture Consolidation**

**CRITICAL DECISION**: Choose primary architecture

#### **Option A: Workflow-First** ‚≠ê **RECOMMENDED**
```
PRIMARY INTERFACE (4 tools):
- infrastructure (Property & Infrastructure Assistant)
- dns (DNS & Domain Management Assistant)  
- security (Security & Compliance Assistant)
- performance (Performance & Analytics Assistant)

POWER USER BACKUP (5 tools):
- property (Comprehensive property management)
- dns (Safe DNS management)
- certificate (Automated SSL/TLS management)
- search (Universal search)
- deploy (Unified deployment)

CORE APIs (15-20 tools):
- Essential CRUD operations only
- Remove duplicates and "enhanced" versions
```

**Benefits**: Best UX for business users, clear upgrade path, maintainable

#### **Option B: Consolidated-First**
```
PRIMARY INTERFACE (5 tools):
- Keep consolidated tools as main interface
- Remove workflow assistants and most individual tools
```

**Benefits**: Clean technical interface, maximum power-user control

#### **Option C: Individual-First** ‚ùå **NOT RECOMMENDED**
```
- Keep individual tools but consolidate heavily
- Remove other layers
```

**Problems**: Still too complex, maintenance overhead remains high

### **üìÅ File Organization Restructure**

**CURRENT PROBLEMS**:
- 61 files in `/tools/` root directory
- Functionality scattered across multiple files
- No clear naming conventions

**RECOMMENDED STRUCTURE**:
```
/tools/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /core/           # Essential operations (10-15 files max)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ property-core.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dns-core.ts  
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ certificate-core.ts
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ hostname-core.ts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /advanced/       # Complex operations (5-10 files max)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /workflows/      # Business assistants (keep current 4)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ /consolidated/   # Simplified tools (keep current 5)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ /specialty/      # Domain-specific edge cases
```

**Expected Phase 3 Result**: 25-30 total tools (85% reduction)

---

## üìà Specific Duplicates Identified

### **Property Management - Scattered Across 7 Files**
```
CONSOLIDATE THESE:
1. property-tools.ts (Basic CRUD)
2. property-manager-tools.ts (Management operations)  
3. property-manager-advanced-tools.ts (Advanced operations)
4. property-operations-advanced.ts (Bulk operations)
5. property-version-management.ts (Version operations)
6. property-activation-advanced.ts (Activation operations)
7. property-onboarding-tools.ts (Onboarding workflows)

INTO:
1. property-core.ts (CRUD, activation, basic operations)
2. property-advanced.ts (Bulk operations, complex workflows)
```

### **Hostname Management - 6 Files with Overlap**
```
CONSOLIDATE THESE:
1. property-manager-tools.ts (addPropertyHostname, removePropertyHostname)
2. property-manager-advanced-tools.ts (listAllHostnames, listEdgeHostnames)
3. hostname-discovery-engine.ts (Discovery and analysis)
4. hostname-management-advanced.ts (Advanced operations)
5. edge-hostname-management.ts (Edge hostname operations)
6. bulk-hostname-operations.ts (Bulk operations)

INTO:
1. hostname-core.ts (Basic CRUD operations)
2. hostname-advanced.ts (Discovery, bulk operations, analysis)
```

### **Naming Inconsistencies to Fix**
```
STANDARDIZE THESE PATTERNS:
- "cert" vs "certificate" ‚Üí Always use "certificate"
- "-enhanced" vs "-advanced" vs no suffix ‚Üí Use "-advanced" only when needed
- Inconsistent parameter naming across similar functions
```
