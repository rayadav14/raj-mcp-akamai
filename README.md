# ALECS - MCP Server for Akamai

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that enables AI assistants to manage Akamai's edge platform through natural language.

> **Note**: This is an unofficial community project and comes without any support or warranty from Akamai Technologies.

## Update regading ALECS

**Stability over sprawl**. I have made the hard decision to remove alot of tools for now. ALECS 1.6 now focuses on ~25 core tools that actually work and is well tested with Akamai APIs. 

The plan is to slowy bring things back as we go and can make them stable, focusing on new worklows made possible with Elicitation in the new MCP spec from June 18, 2025.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/acedergren/alecs-mcp-server-akamai.git
cd alecs-mcp-server-akamai
npm install

# Configure credentials
cp .edgerc.example ~/.edgerc
# Edit ~/.edgerc with your Akamai credentials

# Run
npm start
```

## Core Features

- **Property Management** - Full CRUD operations on CDN properties
- **DNS** - Zone and record management with change-list workflow
- **Certificates** - DV certificate enrollment and management
- **FastPurge** - Content invalidation and cache management
- **Network Lists** - IP/Geo blocking and security lists
- **Account switching** - Account switching for with switch-key for those who need it ;)

## Configuration

### Akamai Credentials (.edgerc)

Create `~/.edgerc` with your Akamai API credentials:

```ini
[default]
client_secret = your_client_secret
host = your_host.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = your_access_token
client_token = your_client_token

[production]
client_secret = prod_client_secret
host = prod_host.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = prod_access_token
client_token = prod_client_token
account_key = 1-ABCDEF
```

### Claude Desktop Integration

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "alecs": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/alecs-mcp-server-akamai/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "AKAMAI_EDGERC_PATH": "~/.edgerc"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Property Management
```
"List all my Akamai properties"
"Create property example.com using Ion Standard"
"Activate property to staging"
```

### DNS Management
```
"List DNS zones"
"Add A record for www.example.com pointing to 192.0.2.1"
"Migrate DNS from Cloudflare"
```

### FastPurge
```

### Live API Test Suites

```bash
# Run comprehensive CRUD tests
npm run build
npx tsx test-all-crud-live.ts     # All operations with detailed reporting
npx tsx test-dns-crud-live.ts      # DNS-specific CRUD tests
npx tsx test-certificate-crud-live.ts # Certificate lifecycle tests

# Test results show:
# ✅ DNS: 100% CRUD coverage - all operations verified
# ✅ Certificates: Full lifecycle tested - enrollment to deployment
# ✅ Type Safety: Zero 'any' assertions in CPS tools
# ✅ API Compliance: Validated against official Akamai specs
```

### Current Test Results

- **Multi-Customer Geo-Blocking**: Geographic controls per customer
- **Property Ownership Validation**: Prevents cross-customer access
- **Cross-Customer Threat Intelligence**: Shared insights (anonymized)

#### **Performance & Scaling**
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized performance for multiple tenants
- **Per-Customer Monitoring**: Individual metrics and circuit breakers
- **Horizontal Scaling**: Multiple server instances for load distribution
- **Dynamic Tool Loading**: Customer-specific tool sets on demand

### 🔄 **Multi-Customer Configuration**

#### **.edgerc Multi-Customer Structure**
```ini
[default]                    # Default/primary customer
client_secret = default_secret
host = default.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = default_token
client_token = default_client

[client-acme]               # Service provider client 1
client_secret = acme_secret
host = acme.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = acme_token
client_token = acme_client
account_switch_key = B-M-ACME123

[client-beta]               # Service provider client 2
client_secret = beta_secret
host = beta.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = beta_token
client_token = beta_client

[division-media]            # Enterprise division 1
client_secret = media_secret
host = media.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = media_token
client_token = media_client

[testing]                   # Test environment (dedicated section)
client_secret = test_secret
host = test.luna.akamaiapis.net
access_token = test_token
client_token = test_client
```

#### **Customer Parameter Usage**
All tools support the `customer` parameter for multi-account operations:

```bash
# Examples with different customers
"List properties for customer client-acme"
"Get traffic summary for customer division-media" 
"Create property for customer client-beta"
"Switch to customer testing environment"
```

### 🚀 **Deployment Architecture Progression**

**Phase 1**: Local .edgerc multi-customer → **Phase 2**: OAuth sessions → **Phase 3**: Distributed credential service → **Phase 4**: Enterprise SaaS

The architecture supports everything from basic multi-customer setups to **full enterprise SaaS deployment** with OAuth authentication, role-based access control, and complete customer isolation.
