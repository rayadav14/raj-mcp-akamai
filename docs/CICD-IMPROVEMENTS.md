# CI/CD Improvements (KISS Edition)

## What Changed

### 1. Simplified Workflows

- **Before**: 14 complex workflows with many dependencies
- **After**: 5 simple workflows that do one thing well

### 2. Active Workflows

- **test.yml** - Simple CI that builds first, then runs non-blocking checks
- **release-simple.yml** - One-click release with version bump, tag, and Docker
- **deploy.yml** - Manual deployment to servers
- **tag-release.yml** - Auto-tags on version change
- **dependency-update.yml** - Weekly dependency updates
- **daily.yml** - Daily maintenance

### 3. Archived Workflows

Moved complex workflows to `.github/workflows/archived/`:

- auth-integration-test.yml
- claude-code-review.yml
- e2e-tests.yml
- security-test-suite.yml
- And others...

### 4. Non-Blocking CI

All checks are non-blocking to allow faster iteration:

```yaml
- name: Lint Check (non-blocking)
  run: npm run lint || true
  continue-on-error: true
```

### 5. Better Docker Support

- Multi-stage Dockerfile for smaller images
- Health checks included
- Simple docker-compose.yml for local development

### 6. Developer Experience

Added Makefile for common tasks:

```bash
make help          # Show available commands
make build         # Build the project
make docker-build  # Build Docker image
make docker-run    # Run in Docker
make release-minor # Release new minor version
```

## Usage

### Local Development

```bash
# Traditional
npm install
npm run build
npm run start:websocket

# With Docker
make docker-build
make docker-run

# With docker-compose
docker-compose up
```

### Releasing

```bash
# Manual via GitHub Actions
# Go to Actions ‚Üí Release ‚Üí Run workflow

# Or via Makefile
make release-patch  # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.0.1
make release-minor  # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 1.1.0
make release-major  # 1.0.0 ‚Üí 2.0.0
```

### CI Status

- ‚úÖ Builds always complete
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Lint/test failures don't block (but are visible)
- üöÄ Fast feedback loop
- üì¶ Automatic Docker builds on release

## Philosophy

1. **Build First** - If it doesn't build, nothing else matters
2. **Fail Fast** - See issues quickly but don't block progress
3. **Manual Control** - Releases and deploys are intentional
4. **Simple is Better** - Fewer workflows, less complexity
5. **Developer Friendly** - Easy commands, clear feedback
